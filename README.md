# Love Running 

![landing](assets/images/love-running.png)

A simple static website using html and css. 

It is part of a tutorial I used to learn html and css. 

It is about a fake running group based in Dublin Ireland. It includes a landing page, a gallery and a sign up page. 

You can see the deployed site [here](https://xiaoniuniu89.github.io/love-running/)
